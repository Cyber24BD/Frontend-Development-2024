    <h2>What is CSS ?</h2>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. It was first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 and has since evolved into a powerful tool for web designers. CSS allows you to change the layout, colors, and fonts of your website, making it visually appealing and user-friendly</p>
